        <p>Pupin's 1899 patent for loading coils, archaically called "Pupin coils", followed closely on the
            pioneering
            work
            of the English physicist and mathematician Oliver Heaviside, which predates Pupin's patent by some seven
            years.
            The importance of the patent was made clear when the American rights to it were acquired by American
            Telephone &
            Telegraph (AT&T), making him wealthy. Although AT&T bought Pupin's patent, they made little use of it,
            as
            they
            already had their own development in hand led by George Campbell and had up to this point been
            challenging
            Pupin
            with Campbell's own patent. AT&T were afraid they would lose control of an invention which was immensely
            valuable due to its ability to greatly extend the range of long distance telephones and especially
            submarine
            ones.</p>
